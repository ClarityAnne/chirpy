<h1>Gracious Greetings!</h1>
<img src="/image/ornament/candles.gif" class="right plain" style="width:40%"/><p>I’m a feminine monotheist. I worship one God, and I worship Her in a feminine form. I refer to Her simply as <em>God</em> because She is, to me, the singular divinity of the universe. To me, God is Mother because she is the Creatrix of all life, and She is God because she is omnipresent and omnipotent. In my perspective, She is <em>not</em> a polytheistic “goddess,” though I sometimes look to media of such, and I do believe much of it to be inspired. </p>

<p>It has been a long and crooked journey over the last two and a half decades, but <a href="/begin/she.html">God as the Queen of Everything</a> - and God <em>as</em> God, not as one neopagan goddess amongst many - kept appearing in my life. It would be foolish of me to ignore Her at this juncture. I sought Her in many different spiritual paths over the years, some yielding positive experiences, some <a href="https://aristasia.guide">not</a>. I’m quite old now, and I want Her to be the center of my spiritual life.</p>

<p>One way or another, Her love comforts and sustains me, and has made me the person I am today. Arguably, much of this occurred without my choice, and without even my awareness. I’ve got a lot to learn still, like most of us, and I struggle to develop patience. I wanted to create a digital shrine to express my own perspectives and feelings about Her and feminine monotheism as a whole.</p>

<p>I’m not trying to convert anyone to this particular belief system. I also recognize that She speaks to each of us differently, and someone else might find Her in a different form, perhaps one that I find unrecognizable. It’s good if someone else finds what I share her directly helpful on their spiritual journey, but that’s not my direct intent. Rather, I opened this site as a way of collecting <a href="/love/beauty.html">beautiful things</a> and <a href="/love/words.html">information about God</a> in a feminine, monotheistic form. </p>

<p>Given that so little online covers this in a decent manner, I wanted to share what I could, while also pasting together images, links, and more that speak to me. I also hope to <a href="/begin/history.html">challenge certain historical misinformation</a> that comes both from neopaganism and more traditional faiths. I’m not an historian, but I’ll do my best to share resources. I’ll also be explaining why I, personally, do not believe something needs to be ancient to be “valid,” for example, and more. I <em>do</em> plan to share my own beliefs that <a href="/love/gnosis.html">might be unique</a>, ie, unverifiable personal gnosis, and I make no apologies for that.</p>

<p>If you find this introduction intriguing or merely bemusing, perhaps visit my <a href="/site/faq.html">frequent questions page</a>, which addresses common confusions about this little project. More information about me <a href="/site/about.html">is available here</a>. Keep in mind that this shrine was created in late May of 2025, and much of the material I hope to post here is yet to be transmuted into HTML or uploaded. You can follow the site’s journey to fullness on the <a href="/site/index.html#updates">updates section below</a>.</p>

<p>If you have anything in particular to <em>say</em> to me on the subject of this shrine, its contents, or would like to discuss spiritual topics in any form, I can be reached via email as <em>clarity at fabled.day</em> or through discord (<em>clarityanne</em>). Additionally, you can use the contact form on the <a href="/site/about.html">about page</a> if necessary. I might add a cbox later.</p>

<p>Be mindful that most kinds of bigots will be blocked on sight from this <a href="https://neocities.org/site/callhershe">neocities profile</a>. This includes transphobes and Trump supporters. Exceptions will be made for bigots, fash, and TERFs when I feel like arguing with them for practice, but that isn't often. I really do not find arguing online to be healthy and am trying to get away from it.</p>

<h2 id="updates">Site Updates</h2>
<p>Below is a simple log of changes and major updates to this website. Not all updates, especially aesthetic changes, are included, but I will link to all pages as I add them. Currently, as of June 2025, very, very little is uploaded, but will be soon!</p>

<ul id="changes">
        <li><span>June 2nd 2025</span> Public (and <em>only</em> public) inquiries and comments can now go in my <a href="/site/ask.html">askbox</a>, but I do filter it..</li>
        <li><span>June 2nd 2025</span> I'm struggling to ultimately decide on a name for the site. Tentatively, I've named it <em>Call Her She</em>, but am thinking of changing it...</li>
    <li><span>June 1st 2025</span> This site is, for the most part, open, though no content is online save for the <a href="/site/faq.html">frequent questions page</a>.</li>
