  <h1>Well Met in Springtime</h1>
<img src="image/lantern.png" class="lantern"><p>Grab the lantern. Enter a shady copse of MIDI, a veritable forest overgrown with digitally-produced sounds. These small files <a href="https://fabled.day/before/">were once</a> common on all sorts of independent websites. Now? You rarely see them <em>anywhere</em>. In fact, many sites disallow sharing them, and some browsers now find it difficult to play them. Welcome, for better or worse, to the MIDI Forest.</p>

<p>MIDI itself stands for <em>musical instrument digital interface</em>. This American-Japanese file format developed in the 1980s as a way to help machines understand musical instruments. Rather than transmitting actual audio, MIDI sends <em>instructions.</em> These include which note to play, how loud, for how long, and with what kind of expression (e.g., pitch bend, vibrato, sustain pedal).This makes MIDI massively flexible, enabling one small file to control entire <em>orchestras</em> of virtual instruments without storing <em>any</em> sound data itself.</p>

<p>MIDI created a universal language that allowed keyboards, synthesizers, drum machines, and digital audio workstations to interconnect seamlessly, regardless of brand. This standardization meant a musician could record a performance on a keyboard, edit it on a computer, and play it back using a completely different synth. </p>

<p>Today, MIDI is <em>still</em> a core part of modern music technology, even if it has fallen out of favor on the World Wide Web. At its core, MIDI remains precise, language-like system for telling machines <em>how</em> to think about music, not <em>“what”</em> the music sounds like. If audio is a recording of a singer’s voice, MIDI is the sheet music they’re reading from! And any instrument can interpret it, in infinite ways.</p>

<p>The green grove you now enter is a testimony to the ubiquity of MIDI in times past, as is the general aesthetic ambiance it partakes of. Websites in the <a href="https://fabled.day/before/">Before Times</a> often featured autoplaying MIDI files in the background. While this site (as of today) doesn’t have <em>any</em> autoplay, you can download plenty of MIDI from it, or just play them within your browser…</p>

<p>Hear well the <em>glorious</em> echoes of ages past! Certain <em>MID</em> files were included as part of the operating system back in the 1990s. These would quickly become fun fixtures of my childhood, all of which are thankfully now preserved on the Web. Check out these absolute bangers! You can download them all in zip format below, or click through them each above and listen one by one…</p>

<p>Wondering how I managed to play <em>.MID</em> files in your browser? It was tricky, and I don't understand it well, myself! For more information, see <a href="https://github.com/cifkao/html-midi-player" target="_blank">the <strong>html-midi-player</strong> repository</a> on GitHub.</p>
