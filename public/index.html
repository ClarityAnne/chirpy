  <h1>Well Met in Midsummer</h1>
<img src="image/lantern.png" class="lantern"><img src="image/mage.png" class="mage"><p>Grab the lantern!</p><p>Enter the mystic, shady forest of MIDI, overgrown with luminous and lush digitally-produced sounds. These wondrous little musical files adorned the independent websites of the 1990s and 2000s. They were like spells cast of pure sound on the Web of yore…. Typing the shiny, <em>secretive</em> and shrinking HTML tag <em>&lt;bgsound src=“url.mid”&gt;</em> would, <a href="https://midis.fandom.com/wiki/Bgsound_(Website_BGM)">in earlier browsers</a>, play a MIDI file in the background of a webpage directly. Even as Napster and MP3s gained speed, sites still existed for trading MIDI files, and I remember seeing them well into the 2000s.</p>

<p>Now? You rarely see anything about them <em>anywhere</em> unless you go on some sort of valiant quest for them directly (which you may well have done, having reached <em>this</em> particular site). Things have, after all, changed quite a bit. In fact, many sites <em>disallow</em> sharing MIDI, and some browsers now find it difficult to play them. I’m not quite sure why this happened, being fuzzy on the particularities but heavily nostalgic about the MIDI files themselves. </p>

<p>Anyways, fair travelers… I’m going to be doing what I can to make these eerie, awkward musical entities available to you here, though. Lit by the glow of wizardly spells cast over America Online’s ghostly ruins… you’ve entered a verdant shrine to a deeply-enchanted and endangered file format, the mysteries of which I’ve surely only begun to explore in my nostalgizing.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI">MIDI</a> itself stands for <em>musical instrument digital interface</em>. This American-Japanese file format developed in the 1980s as a way to help computers understand music. It’s usually credited to Dave Smith at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequential_Circuits">Sequential Circuits</a> and Ikutaro Kakehashi at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_Corporation">Roland</a>, with the first specification finalized at a trade show demonstration in January of 1983.</p>

<p>Rather than transmitting actual audio, MIDI sends <em>instructions.</em> These include which note to play, how loud, for how long, and with what kind of expression. This makes MIDI massively flexible, enabling one small file to control entire <em>orchestras</em> of virtual instruments without storing <em>any</em> sound data itself.</p>

<p>MIDI created a language that was crystalline and beautiful. It allowed keyboards, synthesizers, and digital audio workstations to interconnect seamlessly, regardless of brand. This standardization meant a musician could record a performance on a keyboard, edit it on a computer, and play it back using a completely different synth. For reasons I don’t quite understand, MIDI was also used to trigger lighting effects for theme park displays - strange, but true.</p>

<p>Today, MIDI is <em>still</em> a core part of modern music technology, even if they’ve fallen out of favor on the World Wide Web. MIDI is a precise, language-like system for telling machines <em>how</em> to think about music, not <em>what</em> the music sounds like. If audio is a recording of a singer’s voice, MIDI is the sheet music they’re reading from. Any instrument can interpret it, in infinite ways. </p>

<p>Websites in early days of the World Wide Web often featured autoplaying MIDI files in the background. I have no plans to include autoplay here, but you can play files here, and download them, for sure! I am trying to collect and curate all the major “classics” of MIDI music from my childhood here, as well as some other fun MIDI files I’ve been able to find, information about what MIDI means and more that I am able to find as I learn the <em>why</em> of <em>how</em> and the <em>how</em> of <em>why</em> these arcane spells masquerading as audio files have mostly disappeared from the web.</p>

<p>Hear well the <em>glorious</em> echoes of ages past! Certain <em>MID</em> files were included as part of the operating system back in the 1990s. These would quickly become fun fixtures of my childhood. <em>Canyon.MID</em>, for example, also known as “Trip Through the Grand Canyon,” was composed by George Stone to promote a now-defunct media application called Passport Designs.</p>

<p>I never used the latter, but listened to the the former alongside many of the other <em>.MID</em> files available on my operating system for free as a child. These included one simply called <em>Passport.MID</em>, too, all of which are thankfully now preserved on the Web. Check out these absolute bangers, which you can download as a <a href="/tunes/highlights/highlights.zip">zipped collection here</a> or one by one below! </p>

<p>Wondering how I managed to play a <em>.MID</em> file in your browser? It was tricky, and I don't understand it well, myself!
