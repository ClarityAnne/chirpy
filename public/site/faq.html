<h1>Frequent Questions!</h1>
<img src="/image/ornament/fireheart.gif" class="right plain" style="width:40%"/>

<p>First posted on June 1st, 2025, this page is new and will be subject to many revisions, additions, and rewrites. It is simply the best I can do currently, is long, messy, and often stream-of-consciousness. It attempts to answer questions I've received over the years from those who found out about my beliefs and were curious about them.</p>

<p>If you have anything in particular to say about this shrine, its contents, or would like to discuss spiritual topics in any form, I can be reached via email as&nbsp;<em>clarity at fabled.day</em>&nbsp;or through discord (<em>clarityanne</em>). Additionally, you can use the contact form on the&nbsp;<a href="https://she.fabled.day/site/about.html">about page</a>&nbsp;if necessary. Public (and <em>only</em> public) inquiries and comments go in my <a href="/site/ask.html">askbox</a>, but I do filter it..</p>


<h2>Why She?</h2>

<p>Quite simply, why <em>not</em> She? </p>

<p>We’re all <em>more than</em> aware that many venerate a masculine deity of sorts. In the West, this is particularly manifest in Christianity (“Our Father, who art…”). Many of us criticize the way these religions have historically treated women and other marginalized identities, but few (if <em>anyone</em>) has ever taken exception to the simple <em>idea</em> of worshiping God as a male. And rightly so, given that many find God the Father a spiritually strengthening notion.</p>

<p>Why then, is the idea of God as feminine troublesome? Is it a reactionary concept? We are, after all, <em>utterly bombarded</em> with images of God the Father throughout most of the West for our entire lives. Are we merely rebelling (and, perhaps childishly, at that) against that ideas? Is it really so offensive and terrible to imagine that a woman (of <em>any</em> sort) might be drawn to such a concept? Heavens, not <em>just</em> women, but <em>men</em> too? And others?</p>

<p>Of course, not <em>everyone</em> will find spiritual nourishment in the concept of God as She. Many will find it much more suitable to approach God as Father, or as genderless, or as a plurality, etc. Regardless, God (<em>I believe</em>) loves us all equally and longs for us each to approach in our own way.</p>

<h2>Don’t you mean God<em>dess</em>?</h2>

<p>No. I see <em>absolutely</em> no reason to append that suffix to the word here. To me, the term God<em>dess</em> implies that <em>God</em> is a gendered term, and that a plurality (or at very least duality) of divinity exists. I am a <em>monotheist</em>, so that’s not quite part of my beliefs. If I want to speak of God (who I address as Her), I will. If I want to speak of other spirits, I will. If I want to speak of images which act as foci for devotion (ie, ancient goddess forms, etc) I will. </p>

<p>Regardless, as a monotheist and a feminine one at that, I see no reason to refer to the absolute creator of the universe as anything other than simply <em>God</em>. If someone on the street asks me “do you believe in God?” I will simply nod, because it’s the truth. I believe in one Supreme Being who I see as Creatrix of the entire universe, omnipotent and omnipresent. Perhaps the person asking wouldn’t realize it, of course, but I… call Her She. If asked whether I “worship a Goddess,” well, I’d have to ask <em>many more</em> follow-up questions and clarify a lot more things…</p>

<p>On this site (and in other places online) I often share and delight in older images <em>of</em> goddesses; this is because I believe the Light of the Mother <em>shines through</em> them, but it can be difficult for me to articulate this. I do not appropriate images of goddesses from colonized cultures, but I delight in those from my own heritage and from Ancient Greece and Rome, where Athena, Aphrodite, and others seem to have been mouthpieces for Her at times. Perhaps that was true of goddesses elsewhere; it is not my place to say…</p>

<h2>Wasn’t She worshiped in ancient times?</h2>

<p>Yes and no. The matter is much more complicated than many people realize. It probably needs its own article, and will get <a href="/begin/history.html">one at a later date</a>…</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The Great Goddess—the Divine Ancestress—had been worshiped from the beginnings of the Neolithic periods of 7000 BC until the closing of the last Goddess temples, about AD 500. Some authorities would extend Goddess worship as far into the past as the Upper Paleolithic Age of about 25,000 BC.”</p><cite>Merlin Stone,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/31192">When God Was a Woman</a></cite>
</blockquote>

<p>Such a beautiful idea, isn’t it? All of humanity worshiping one supreme being - in this case, a Great Goddess - prior to the quarrels of the parts of history we truly <em>know</em>. It appears in sources as far afield as the above art historian, various late-20th-century anthropologists, even the notorious Silver Ravenwolf, and dozens of other pagan authors.</p>

<p>The issue? It isn’t, as far as historians have recently been able to determine, true. It sounds wonderful, and it was <em>just</em> the kind of thing to capture the popular imagination in the 1960s and 1970s especially, one must admit. It lacks evidence, though, and often stems from the earlier faulty work of a man named Eduard Gerhard (amongst others)</p>

<p>Gerhard’s romantic notions in his own time created a host of misinformation and difficulties for years to come. They are not easily summarized. He was quite fond of focusing overly-much on the iconography of a society and drawing assumptions about worship, social structure, etc, based on that. This often included some huge leaps. He, for one, assumed that a preponderance of feminine iconography indicated a matriarchy - or, at very least, monotheistic goddess worship. This was a mistake. We realize this now, having wiped the glitter of his (and later) romanticism (and some of the vindictiveness against other strains of monotheism).</p>

<p>So, no. The worship of a Great Earth Mother wasn’t a universal feature like some claim. And yet, the presence of, and traditions honoring, the Feminine Divine <em>are</em> as old as time, and <em>do</em> show up throughout history, even if they weren’t that pervasive and ubiquitous. Many ancient people were polytheists; this can’t be denied. The goddesses whose images we see strung about the ancient world were likely just that - one entity worshiped amongst a pantheon of many others, sharing space with many, including male deities.</p>

<p>Feminine monotheism may <em>or may not</em> have had an historical precedent - that, to me, remains unclear. I’m <em>not</em> an historian, and while I do want to learn as much as I can, I also <em>don’t care</em> to a degree - my relationship with Her remains regardless of whether She was worshiped in ancient times. A lack of historical precedent doesn’t invalidate a spiritual belief (such as this) any more than a long history makes it more valid, after all. I doubt we’re the first generation to hear Her call, and even if we were, I’d still answer.</p>

<h2>Can I join this religion?</h2>

<p>Nope. </p>

<p>It’s just <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unverified_personal_gnosis">me and Her</a>. You’ll have to form a relationship with God of your own. This site is just my own small devotional act. If you enjoy reading and visiting it, well, I’m glad, and I hope I’ve done right by the Blessed Lady. Worship of God as Mother is not an organized religion, and especially not as I practice it. </p>

<p>The closest thing to that <em>might</em> be Madrianism, Déanism or Filianism. I didn’t find much spiritual nourishment in these, but you may feel differently. I really think anyone looking into <em>those</em> should read a bit about their origins, though - it isn’t exactly a <a href="https://aristasia.guide">pretty picture</a>, to be quite honest…</p>

<p>My advice? Pray. She’ll listen.</p>

<h2>Are you <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicca">Wiccan</a> or neopagan? </h2>

<p>No.</p>

<p>I do not worship a “God and Goddess.” I do not worship an “Earth Mother.”</p>

<p>My perspective differs from mainstream neopaganism insofar as I’m a monotheist. I do not see God as a plurality, but rather singular and whole in and of Herself. At least, that is how She wishes to be perceived by me, I suppose. Perhaps this <em>is</em> Her as She actually is; perhaps it’s just what I, myself (and maybe others) might need.</p>

<p>These things are rather strange, and one can never know the <em>truth</em> for sure. I <em>do</em> recognize the existence of spirits, some of which are quite formidable and may act as Divine messengers of sorts. This isn’t something I understand completely (nor does anyone, I expect), despite years in the occult. </p>

<p>Still, I’m not a polytheist, and thus, in that way, am <em>not</em> a neopagan in the sense that most people understand it. <em>That said</em>, I do use imagery drawn from (<em>quite</em> open) cultures that engaged in polytheistic goddess worship, such as Ancient Greece, for the sake of spiritual focus and nourishment. </p>

<p>I take these images as <em>God</em>, though - not (ie) Aphrodite or Hera; they may represent Her acting in a particular role (<em>to me</em>, anyways), but are nevertheless a singular God Herself, not one amongst a plurality of godforms. </p>

<p>They were <em>created</em> by individuals with a polytheistic connection to the Divine, though, and that means they do tend to show Her colored by a particular lens. God as She, after all, is not <em>merely</em> She - here, we’re speaking of God as Warrior, God as Teacher, and God as much more…</p>

<h2>Are you a misandrist?</h2>

<p>No. </p>

<p>Men are not a problem. Perhaps one can speak of patriarchy, but not merely of men. Most are quite good company. I’ve met several gentlemen over the years who shared my feelings about God. All sorts of people end up seeking the Feminine Divine - <em>and</em> finding Her.</p>

<h2>Is She always Mother?</h2>

<p>In a way, yes! Insofar as God is our Creator and caretaker of sorts, yes, She is and will always be our Mother in Her feminine capacity. All humans, regardless of gender or physical fertility, have a generative ability because we are made in Her image. This may take countless forms. </p>

<p>When a woman (specifically) exercises it, she would often be called the “mother” of her creation to some degree. This is especially true if the creation is something like <em>us</em> that can think for ourselves! So, yes, God <em>is</em> Mother, because God is <em>Creator</em>. </p>

<p>At the same time, this needn’t (and <em>shouldn’t</em>) be reduced to the physicality of human procreation. Giving birth to the universe, after all, differs greatly from giving birth to a baby. The latter is one amongst many crude physical reflections of the former. </p>

<p>The central image we’ve been fed for so many years of “the Mother Goddess” as a pregnant woman with the world in her tummy may appeal to some, and I understand that. I, however, can’t help but see it as just another small line amidst the vast spectrum of Her Light, which includes all sorts of feminine ways of being. </p>

<p>We shouldn’t force ourselves to obsess over those mired in biology when we’ve the entirety of feminine experience (which, I believe, reflects Her ultimately).</p>

<h2>Are you a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TERF_(acronym)">TERF</a>?</h2>

<p>Heavens, no. I’ve fought TERFs before (physically, but we won’t get into that). I’ll do so again if the need arises, too. I want to be as clear as possible about this, though, because I believe God expects nothing less of me than complete support of all my sisters, including those who are trans. It’s true that some people who call themselves devotees of a “Mother” or a “Goddess”-like deity do not honor the personhood of trans women as they should, and that makes me very sad. I want to do much better, if I can.</p>

<h2>Are you a <a href="http://www.mother-god.com/">Filianist</a>, Madrian, or Déanist?</h2>

<p>No.</p>

<p>At an incredibly young age when I ought to have been better supervised online, I found myself on Déanist sites within the auspices of a strange cult-like group known as <a href="https://aristasia.guide">Aristasia</a>. It was here that I first truly encountered the concept of feminine monotheism, and yes, I found it spoke to me. This is (<em>one</em>) part of why I ended up inside Aristasia for many years, despite my values increasingly clashing with that of the group itself. </p>

<p>That said, I found little nourishment in the scriptures themselves, known as <a href="https://archive.org/details/the-eastminster-critical-edition-of-the-clear-recital">The Clear Recital</a>, though I tried my hardest. I cannot make decisions <em>for</em> anyone else, but I want to warn folks that the belief systems that spread from this and related groups do tend to have a strain of authoritarianism baked in. Read the literature, and read about the history of these groups, the lies that were told, etc, and make your own decisions.</p>

<h2>Does this have something to do with that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_Has_Won">Mother God cult</a> in the news?</h2>

<p>No. I don’t worship a creepy (now dead) woman wrapped in Christmas lights. It honestly makes my skin crawl that Love Has Won even exists and uses that phrasing (“Mother God”), and I wish that creep had never started calling herself “Mother God.” The sheer hubris of that charlatan amazes and horrifies me. It would be funny if it weren’t so spiritually ugly and disgusting.</p>
